Explanation and Solution:
In order to figure out how many times map method is invoked one can simply
utilize wordcount in order to "count" the number of times that the method
is called. Starting in the map method we create a string variable called map
which is initalized to "map". From there we then place a write command in the
correct loop. Thus, everytime the method is invoked the program will write "map"
to the output file. Reduce will total the numbers for us and then in the output
file we will see (map  258). Which alligns with the answer provided for us.
